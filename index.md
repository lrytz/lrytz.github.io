I am a software engineer at [Lightbend](http://www.lightbend.com/) working on the Scala compiler.

Before joining Lightbend, I did a PhD at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/), Switzerland, working in [Martin Odersky](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/)'s lab named [LAMP](http://lamp.epfl.ch/).

I did a fair amount of hacking in the Scala compiler during my time at Lightbend, and also during my PhD. For example, I designed and implemented [named and default arguments](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/completed/named-and-default-arguments.html) in Scala 2.8. More recently I worked on the [bytecode optimzier in Scala 2.12 and 2.13](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/scala-inliner-optimizer).

My [doctoral research](/pubsTalks/) was about systems for controlling side-effects in non-purely-functional programming languages. Concretely, I was working on a generic type-and-effect system for [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). The project page is [on Github](https://github.com/lrytz/efftp).

In my computer-free time, I enjoy listening and playing music, climbing mountains and piloting small airplanes. Well, I hope to get back to doing these things once the kids are a little older!
